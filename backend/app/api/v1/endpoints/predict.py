"""Test playground: run trained models on an image (or dataset frame) and get
detections back — no DB writes. Also manages warm model residency for fast
repeated tests / A-B comparison.

The endpoint is thin: resolve model paths + image path (business), then hand the
raw compute to InferManager (which owns the warm worker). torch never loads here.
